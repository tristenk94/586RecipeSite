This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.0.

## Development server

This is Tristen Khatibi's 586 Project. It is a recipe website that retreives recipes along with their related ingredients and directions through a view model.

The website also features authentication with [ ] to control what level of actions that can be performed.  Definitely rough around the edges but it still operates ok if I do say so myself :)
